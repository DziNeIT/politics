## Politics
Politics is an ultra-configurable self-serve community management system, built for all Bukkit-based Minecraft servers.

By configuring Politics to your liking, it can reproduce the systems offered by other plugins, like Towny or Factions, or it can be something else entirely. Politics' configurability makes it somewhat complicated, but pre-made configuration templates are offered to allow anyone to use it with ease. Once you've understood how the configuration works, it becomes fairly easy to build unique and specific configurations.

A detailed guide to configuring and using Politics on your Bukkit server will be available on the wiki.

Documentation (Wiki): https://github.com/dzineit/politics/wiki

### Downloads

Politics is currently not in a production-usable state and large swathes of the plugin are untested, so there is no stable version to download. If you'd like to acquire a developer build, they're available through a CI server kindly hosted by CodeMC.org.

- Latest Release: N/A
- Developer Builds (CI): https://ci.codemc.org/job/dzineit/job/politics/

### Contributing

There are two main ways to contribute to Politics, depending on whether you're experienced with Java and the Bukkit API.

### Add-ons

Politics is designed to be highly accessible by other plugins. This means that almost any functionality the plugin includes can be modified or hooked into without editing the plugin itself.

The wiki will contain a detailed guide for developers on hooking into Politics.

### Credits

The Bukkit version of Politics is currently solely worked on by [myself](https://github.com/dzineit). However, when it was conceptualised in 2012 it was to be for the Spout game engine, and much of the original core code (some of which is still used) as well as the idea for the plugin was by [Ian Macalinao](https://github.com/macalinao), with contributions from [Jack Huey](https://github.com/kitskub). The original Spout version's source code is available [here](https://github.com/VolumetricPixels/Politics).
